    " # Lab:  Transfer Learning with a Pre-Trained Deep Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed earlier, state-of-the-art neural networks involve millions of parameters that are prohibitively difficult to train from scratch.  In this lab, we will illustrate a powerful technique called *fine-tuning* where we start with a large pre-trained network and then re-train only the final layers to adapt to a new task.  The method is also called *transfer learning* and can produce excellent results on very small datasets with very little computational time.  \n",

    "This lab is based partially on this\n",
    "[excellent blog](https://blog.keras.io/building-powerful-image-classification-models-using-very-little-data.html).  In performing the lab, you will learn to:\n",
    "* Build a custom image dataset\n",
    "* Fine tune the final layers of an existing deep neural network for a new classification task.\n",
    "* Load images with a `DataGenerator`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lab has two versions:\n",
    "* *CPU version*:  In this version, you use lower resolution images so that the lab can be performed on your laptop.  The resulting accuracy is lower.  The code will also take considerable time to execute.\n",
    "* *GPU version*:  This version uses higher resolution images but requires a GPU instance. See the [notes](../GCP/getting_started.md) on setting up a GPU instance on Google Cloud Platform.  The GPU training is much faster (< 1 minute).  \n",

For these applications, the `keras` package provides a `ImageDataGenerator` class that can fetch images on the fly from a directory of images.  Using multi-threading, training can be performed on one mini-batch while the image reader can read files for the next mini-batch. The code below creates an `ImageDataGenerator` for the training data.  In addition to the reading the files, the `ImageDataGenerator` creates random deformations of the image to expand the total dataset size.
